                <p class="spacing"><span class="span1">Python</span> is an interpreted high-level general-purpose
                    programming language. Its design
                    philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language
                    constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code
                    for small and large-scale projects.

                    Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is
                    often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                    <span class="span1">Guido van Rossum</span> began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a
                    successor to the ABC programming
                    language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
                    introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system
                    (in addition to reference counting). Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the
                    language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18
                    in 2020.

                    Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

                <h2>ALL ABOUT DATA SCIENCE</h2>
                <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
                <div class="fakeimgdata">

                <p class="spacing"><span class="span1">Data science</span> is an interdisciplinary field that uses
                    scientific methods, processes,
                    algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured
                    data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application
                    domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

                    Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related
                    methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and
                    theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science,
                    information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science
                    and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm"
                    of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that
                    "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data
                    deluge.

                    A data scientist is someone who creates programming code, and combines it with statistical knowledge
                    to create insights from data.</p>
